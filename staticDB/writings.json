Music is in this sense a perfect example, mainly because it is something we all have experience with and much of the internet and therefore computer usage is geared towards music listening or creation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a physical phenomena, music can be seen as the conscious manipulation of sound waves. Sound is a transference of energy through a medium, normally air, in a range that our sensors (auditory system) can perceive. This distinction is important because x-rays are also waves of energy that we are not equiped to sense, and we don't call x-ray's sound, only what our ears can catch.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://israelsaepblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/sampling.png?w=557&amp;h=245\" style=\"width: 524px;\"><br></p><p><img src=\"http://pgfplots.net/media/tikz/examples/PNG/fourier-transform.png\" style=\"width: 474px;\"><b><br></b></p><p><img src=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/digital-audio/images/6/68/SamplingPic.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140413223513\" style=\"width: 25%;\"></p><p><br></p>"
